### QuikCite: A simple bibliography format

This is a simple CSL bibliography format for informal citations. It uses no conditonal logic or macros, is agnostic of item format or publisher, but does provide an item URL.

A "Hello World" of bibliography formats.

I wanted a bibliographic format that
- Looks good in ascii and on social media
- Uses numeric citations
- Is terse and format agnostic
- Does not use et al. for long author lists
- Doesn't mention the publisher of the item
- But _does_ let the author mention a URL where readers can grab the _actual_ item

QuikCite is useful for Zotero, Mendeley, or Papers.

Here's an example:
